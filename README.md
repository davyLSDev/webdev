# webdev
This is my attempt at creating a webdev environment with an ubuntu 22.04 vagrant box provisioned by ansible

The idea is that this would be a nodejs, Reactjs development machine

## literature

* [deploy nodejs on ubuntu 22.04 desktop](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/deploy-node-js-ubuntu/)
* [vagrnt boxes](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=downloads&provider=&q=ubuntu%2Fjammy64)

## the name of the box I want to use is "ubuntu/jammy64"
